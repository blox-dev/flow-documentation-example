# Part 1: Maintainer

## Setup

Step 0. [Download the extension.](../README.md)

Step 1. Download a copy of the `Odoo` repository to your machine. The latest version of `Odoo` is available [here](`https://github.com/odoo/odoo`).

(We tested this extension on the most recent functional version of Odoo as of [April 24, 2020](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/tree/436be43d49260c905d37927b21b75404f4ccfc1f))

Note: The functionality of the `Odoo` app on your machine is **NOT** a prerequisite for the extension to operate as intended. However, if you wish to enable `Odoo` on your machine, you can refer to the [Setup Guide](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/developer/tutorials/setup_guide.html).

Step 2. Add `maintainerMap.json` to the parent folder of the `Odoo` repository.

Step 3. Open the parent folder with `VSCode`. The `Maintainer` sidebar panel should be available and visible.
